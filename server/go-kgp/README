This is a server implementation of the Kalah Game Protocl (KGP),
written in Go[0].  It implements the base protocol, without any
extensions.  Currently, it only supports the "freeplay" and "simple"
mode.

The only build-dependency is the Go toolchain, version 1.16 or newer.
To compile the server, run

	$ go build

which produces the "go-kgp" binary.

The server can be configured when invoked using a number of flags
(invoke go-kgp with the "-help" flag for a listing) or persistently
using a TOML configuration file.  By default go-kgp checks the current
working directory for a file called "server.toml" and tries to load
it.  The default configuration can be dumped

	$ go-kgp -dump-config > server.toml

and modified.
